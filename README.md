# EPFL Machine Learning Higgs 2019

### Description
EPFL Machine Learning Higgs is a project that was launched in 2014 by the [CERN](https://home.cern/news/news/computing/higgs-boson-machine-learning-challenge) and is aimed to determine the presence of a Higgs Boson with measurements. To do so, a model has to be defined through machine learning methods, with a training data which is supplied.

After the model is determined with the training data, the results are submitted on the [AIcrowd](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/epfl-machine-learning-higgs-2019) platform, to see the accuracy of the model's predictions.

### Getting Started
To run the model's calculation, it is only needed to execute the file `run.py`. The code should return a `.csv` file with all its predictions, from the test data.


### Prerequisites
A train data and a testing data, where the results are unknown, are needed in `.csv` format .These data are available on the [Resources](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/epfl-machine-learning-higgs-2019/dataset_files) of AIcrowd platform.

To avoid dysfunctions, the code need the files .... and .... Those files contain functions that are used by the main code `run.py`.

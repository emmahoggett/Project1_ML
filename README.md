# EPFL Machine Learning Higgs 2019

### Description
EPFL Machine Learning Higgs is a project that was launched in 2014 by the [CERN](https://home.cern/news/news/computing/higgs-boson-machine-learning-challenge) and is aimed to determine the presence of a Higgs Boson with measurements. To do so, a model has to be defined throught machine learning methods, with a training data which is supplied.

After the model is determined with the training data, the results are submitted on the [AIcrowd](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/epfl-machine-learning-higgs-2019) plateform, to see the accuracy of model's predictions.

### Getting Started
To run the model's calculation, 

### Running the test


### Prerequisites
A train data and a testing data, where the results are unknown, are needed in `.csv` format. Those datas are available on the [Resources](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/epfl-machine-learning-higgs-2019/dataset_files) of AIcrowd plateform.
